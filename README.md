## 🎯 Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. Here's how it works:

1. **Choose a task** you want to work on
2. **Set the timer** to 25 minutes (one "Pomodoro")
3. **Work on the task** until the timer rings
4. **Take a short break** (5 minutes)
5. **Every 4 Pomodoros**, take a longer break (15-30 minutes)

### Benefits

- ✅ Improved focus and concentration
- ✅ Reduced mental fatigue
- ✅ Better time management
- ✅ Increased productivity
- ✅ Reduced procrastination
